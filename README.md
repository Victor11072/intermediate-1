# 🚨 Police Activity Analysis: Montgomery County Traffic Violations

A detailed case study analyzing traffic stop data in Montgomery County to uncover patterns in law enforcement actions, demographic trends, and temporal violation patterns.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This intermediate-level project focuses on:

- 📅 **Temporal trends** of traffic violations (hourly, daily, monthly)
- 👥 **Demographic patterns** in violations (gender, race)
- 🧠 **Hypothesis testing** to evaluate assumptions
- 📈 **Data visualization** using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The dataset was carefully cleaned to ensure valid analysis. Key steps:

- Removed missing or irrelevant values
- Converted date and time formats
- Extracted time and day components
- Encoded categorical variables where necessary

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

- 🏷️ **Citation** was the most common violation type, followed by **warnings**
- 👨‍🦱 **Male drivers** were stopped more often than female drivers
- 🕙 Most traffic stops occurred around **10 PM**, with the fewest at **5 AM**
- 📆 **Tuesdays** had the highest number of stops, **Sundays** the least
- 📅 **April** had the highest violation count; **January** the lowest
- 👩 Female drivers were more likely to receive **warnings**, while males received more **citations**

## 📐 Hypothesis Testing

Three hypotheses were tested using statistical methods:

| Hypothesis | Null Hypothesis | Result |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| H1 | No significant relationship between **gender** and **violation type** | ❌ Rejected |
| H2 | No significant relationship between **race** and **violation type** | ❌ Rejected |
| H3 | No significant relationship between **gender** and **seatbelt usage** | ❌ Rejected |

All tests revealed **statistically significant** relationships.

## 📎 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how real-world police activity data can be used to:

- Detect meaningful trends in traffic violations
- Understand behavioral differences across demographics
- Use data-driven methods to test assumptions
